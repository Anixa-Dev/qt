      <strong>${tokenName} Purchase Terms and Conditions</strong>
      <p>
        By purchasing and/or claiming this digital asset ("${tokenName}") from ${companyName} ("We" or "Seller"), you ("You" or "Purchaser") agree to <a href="https://www.counterten.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CounterTEN's Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.counterten.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. In particular, CounterTEN is not a party to the ${tokenName} transaction, and you irrevocably release, acquit, and forever discharge CounterTEN and its officers, directors, and agents of any liability in connection with your use of the ${tokenName} and any dispute related to the ${tokenName}. If you are a California resident using the Service, you may specifically waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
      </p>

      <p>
        You will receive a cryptographic token representing the ${tokenName} as a proof of purchase, but do not own the creative work or content associated with the event. You may display and share the ${tokenName}, but as Purchaser, you do not have any legal ownership, right, or title to any copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights to the event content. However, you shall have a limited, worldwide, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to display the ${tokenName} for the following purposes: (i) promoting or sharing the purchase, ownership, or interest in the ${tokenName}, (ii) sharing, promoting, discussing, or commenting on the event; (iii) on third-party marketplaces, exchanges, platforms, or applications in association with an offer to sell or transfer the ${tokenName}; and (iv) for use within decentralized virtual environments. You shall have the right to sell, trade, transfer, or use the ${tokenName} as specified above, but you may not make "commercial use" of the ${tokenName}.
      </p>

      <p>
        All sales of the ${tokenName} are final. Once you have purchased the ${tokenName}, you should promptly take the necessary steps to complete your transaction by specifying your credit card details, selecting whether to use the CounterTEN custodial digital wallet or specifying your own wallet address, and downloading the ${tokenName} to your Apple or Google mobile wallet. ${tokenName}s may be transferred from the CounterTEN custodial digital wallet to your digital wallet at any time in the future at no additional charge. This may be done directly from the application. Where applicable (as determined by each Seller), you may be able to resell or otherwise transfer the ${tokenName} pursuant to applicable law, provided any sale or transfer must provide for the transfer of all of your rights with respect to the ${tokenName}. Anyone receiving this ${tokenName} from you agrees to and is bound by the terms of the ${tokenName}. The ${tokenName} purchase requires the payment of a transaction fee (a "Gas Fee"). The value of the Gas Fee changes constantly and is entirely outside of the control of Seller. As part of the CounterTEN transaction fee (10% of the transaction sale with a minimum fee of $5.00), CounterTEN assumes all costs relating to Gas Fees and credit card transaction fees for every ${tokenName} transaction—be it on the primary or secondary market.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes imposed by any governmental entity in connection with your use and purchase of the ${tokenName}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seller accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the ${tokenName} will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure, and you should never share your wallet credentials with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider. You are solely responsible for your wallet, and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your wallet being compromised. In the unlikely event that the CounterTEN custodial wallet is compromised, CounterTEN will seek to recover or reissue stolen/missing ${tokenName}s to the extent that is reasonable from a cost and time point of view—but makes no guarantee that compromised ${tokenName}s will be recovered. CounterTEN recommends the use of cold wallet storage for all high-value ${tokenName}s.
      </p>

      <strong>${tokenName} Restrictions</strong>
      <p>
        You agree that you may not, or permit any third party to, do or attempt any of the following without Seller's prior express written consent:
        <ul>

        </ul>
      </p>

      <strong>Indemnification</strong>
      <p>
        By purchasing the ${tokenName}, you agree, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller, and its respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, and other representatives, from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and other expenses that arise directly or indirectly out of or from (a) your breach of the ${tokenName} Terms; (b) your ownership of the ${tokenName}; (c) any transfer or proposed transfer by you of the ${tokenName}; (d) your compliance with applicable laws; and (e) your negligence or willful misconduct.
      </p>

      <strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>
      <p>
        YOUR PURCHASE AND USE OF THE ${tokenName} IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE ${tokenName} IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AND DISCLAIMS ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHETHER THE ${tokenName}: (A) WILL MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS; (B) WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS; OR (C) WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE. SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
      </p>

      <p>
        SELLER WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR: (A) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS OR CORRUPTION; (B) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE; (C) ANY THIRD-PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, CYBER ATTACK AGAINST THE ${tokenName}; AND (D) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN OR MISTAKEN PASSWORDS.
      </p>

      <p>
        THE ${tokenName} EXISTS ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN. ANY TRANSFER OR SALE OF THE ${tokenName} OCCURS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. SELLER CANNOT EFFECT OR OTHERWISE CONTROL THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN THE ${tokenName} AND WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTIVITY OCCURRING ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE ${tokenName}, INCLUDING FORKS, OR TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES.
      </p>

      <p>
        IF YOUR JURISDICTION DOES NOT ALLOW AN EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, THE ABOVE PROVISION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
      </p>

      <strong>Potential Risks Specific to ownership and usage of the ${tokenName}</strong>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that ${tokenName}s carry certain risks among others. We expressly disclaim any responsibility for these risks, including but not limited to the following:
        <ul>
          <li>The risk of hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience when using the Blockchain, however caused;</li>
          <li>${tokenName} prices and markets are extremely volatile and any variations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of any ${tokenName}s you purchase. There is no guarantee that ${tokenName}s will have or retain any value.</li>
          <li>Any transfer of ${tokenName}s occurs within the supporting Blockchain, and not through the Service. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any loss of access to your ${tokenName}s due to loss of your private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, mining attacks, hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks, and other technological difficulties through the Blockchain.</li>
          <li>${tokenName}s are a new product and the regulatory environment is uncertain. New regulations may materially adversely affect the development of the ${tokenName} ecosystem, and therefore the potential value of your ${tokenName}s. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for the risk of changes to the regulatory regime governing digital assets, including ${tokenName}s. In addition, you are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your ${tokenName}-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions through the Service.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR PURCHASE OF THE ${tokenName} OR THESE ${tokenName} TERMS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF SELLER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>

      <p>
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SELLER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE ${tokenName} TERMS OR THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE ${tokenName} OR ${tokenName} CONTENT, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO SELLER FOR THE ${tokenName}. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.
